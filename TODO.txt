README Updates:
How to spin up app using: 
python venv's and uvicorn for backend
python venv and main.py for emulator
npm run dev for frontend (eventually npm run build)
Eventually will do this all using docker compose up and spawning heaps of containers like a mad dog.

Discuss workflow: JSON Contract -> Emulated Devices -> Backend -> UI Connection -> UI Commands -> Backend -> Emulated Devices 
Discuss architecture -> Backend creates a websocket, all simulated IoT devices send messages across that, backend serves those to connected clients to display in a UI
Discuss scalability - Websocket allows for heaps of connections - can just spawn new devices (or plug new ones in IRL) and connect them to the pipeline while following
the JSON contract and it will "just work" - emulated stuff shouldn't have to be touched.

TODOS: 
Update UI to make it fancy pants
Add commands from UI -> Backend -> Emulated device
Make it possible to spawn new Emulated devices on the fly
Add a database to backend to store and query historical data.
Search for other TODO's throughout app... I've added a few that I want to touch on before deploying. Some might not be worth
