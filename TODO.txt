README Updates:
How to spin up app using: 
python venv's and uvicorn for backend
python venv and main.py for emulator
npm run dev for frontend (eventually npm run build)
Eventually will do this all using docker compose up and spawning heaps of containers like a mad dog.
Discuss workflow: JSON Contract -> Emulated Devices -> Backend -> UI Connection -> UI Commands -> Backend -> Emulated Devices 
Discuss architecture -> Backend creates a websocket, all simulated IoT devices send messages across that, backend serves those to connected clients to display in a UI
Discuss scalability - Websocket allows for heaps of connections - can just spawn new devices (or plug new ones in IRL) and connect them to the pipeline while following
the JSON contract and it will "just work" - emulated stuff shouldn't have to be touched.

TODOS:
Update UI to make it fancy pants
- Device Cards
- Alerts Cards
- Alert management
- Second page - configuration management/device specific monitoring?
- modal popups when device or alerts cards are clicked.
- Historical data (charts/filterable tables/logs)
--- connected over time
--- alerts over time
--- logs

Unit testing
---frontend
---backend 
---emulator 
---packages

Github pipeline
--- run unit tests on commit push to remote
--- deploy? 

pre-commit hooks
- run linting before commit, raise any errors (wouldn't mind keeping an example in a private repo for later use... seem to rewrite these all the time)
- run project specific commands pre-commit (i.e generating server type files and converting them to TypeScript).

Add commands from UI -> Backend -> Emulated device

Emulator
- Configurable fields
- Location?
- DeviceType (could link this to icons in the UI for specific types, Lucide React Icons has heaps of device ones.)
- Make specific devices display different data.

Backend
- Add a database to backend to store and query historical data.
- more websocket endpoints
- ping/pong websocket ?
- data wrangling for different devices


Make it possible to spawn and delete new Emulated devices on the fly
Introducing chaos to the system
- devices dropping off
- increase simulated network jitter




Note: Search for other TODO's throughout app... I've added a few that I want to touch on before deploying. Some might not be worth
